//ENHANCED CPP FILE MODIFYING C++ CODE TO MAKE MORE COMPLEX WITH EXPLANATION. 
//BELOW THIS CODE IS THE BEFORE CODE 

#include <iostream>

using namespace std;
//the enhancements of this cpp file was to make it more complex and keep it functioning in the same manner
//by doing so I did the following: Add a case structure, data array that holds clients names, array that holds clients info,
//limit the number of attempts to enter file, add functions getline(cin, junk) and clear to keep file clean, 
//continue to keep user looping the file with more options, bounded the options of clients with if statment, 
//bounded the options to change clients info with if statment, and add a loop to iterate for changes in the clients change

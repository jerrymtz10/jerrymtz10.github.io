I have learned a strength of large number of skills that include development, constructing, secure coding, data, methodologies, reverse engineering, and trouble shooting to name a few. Completing the course work and construction on my portfolio have prepared me to shine a light in the computer science field as I lean to code developing and security. Through this program I have learn to develop projects in python, java, and c++ as my languages. Projects that include working on embedded systems using raspberry pi to showcase my work and learned to write secure code for better performance. I have showcase my skills learned in data by building a database using sql and writing python scripts for mongodb for inputting data to files. My artifacts showcase in my portfolio demonstrate the abilities of my performance that I have learned from the program as I grow to work on more challenges as the future  unfolds opportunities </p>

                            <p>
                                The artifact that I am working on is a cpp file that prompts a user to a login screen which if then the info is entered correctly, he or she is allowed to view and update client’s information. This file was created in a reverse engineering class that was created from the assembly language output where we were to reverse engineer the file and recreated to resemble the executional one provided. 
I selected this item because it was a simple piece of code that could be made a little more complex and yet functional. One of the options provided as recommendation from the rubric was to increase the complicity in a project and seeing how simple this cpp file was it gave me an opportunity to show case my ability of developing skills and to branch out in learning how to enhance a file. The specific components of the artifact that showcase my skills and abilities in the software development, is the ability to work with files and improving them as needed to be structured differently and updated. The artifact was improved by adding a data structure of array that holds the client’s information. It was switch from many if statements to a case structure that made it simpler. 
I strongly feel that I met the course objective from module one as I made the cpp file much more complex from the one I showed to my professor at the beginning of the class and also made it run far more correctly. Updates from my outcome-coverage plans was adding the data structure in the file that allowed for a way to update information in the file when need and a few security functions like getline(cin, junk) that cleared any un need runs in the file. 
A few things that I learned from enhancing this file was the ability to branch out and use other functions that c++ offers to improve file when running and executing. I learned as I researched other functions to use in making this file more complex how to use the continue, junk, getline, and how to build a case in my more complex file, but keeping it simple enough for developers to understand. The challenges I faced was figuring out how to grab and update the data in the array and I did so with a for iteration. Also learning how to input a simple data structure into my file was a little challenged I face but over came by learning from cplusplus website. All these challenges helped me as a developer to increase my knowledge of ways to improve files and make them run correctly.

                                <p>
                                The artifact is from a class IT 45 java class that was to created an authentication system for a zoo. This file was created in my second year at snhu for a programming class that extended my knowledge of other languages to write code. 
	The reason for selecting this artifact was to expand my knowledge recreating certain file languages into others for reverse engineering and knowledge purposes. This displayed my skills and abilities in algorithms and data structure by understanding the java file and re constructing it into another language. By doing so it display my ability in algorithm and data by reproducing this file. The artifact was improve by making sure it execute in the same manner as the original java file, but in another language showing the enhancements of recreating files. 
	I strongly feel I met the course objectives from module one because I explained I would reconstruct the java file from the original form to a c++ file and by doing so I had to make sure all criterias were met from hold a hash table for security to including the text file form the original java file to read the information. My updates were to display a data structure of the zoo employees and their occupations that the text file held to showcase the information needed for the username and password information needed to accesses the file. 
	Through this enhancement I learned a great deal of how different language operate from other and yet still hold the same concept in creating similar functions. A challenge I came across was understanding what I had to do to recreate similar outputs from other languages to the language of my choice and making sure it executed the same form precision
